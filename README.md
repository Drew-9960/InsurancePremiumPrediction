# Insurance Premium Prediction

## Project Overview

This project involves predicting insurance premiums based on various features using machine learning models. The dataset contains information about individuals' age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, along with their insurance charges.

## Files

- `Insurance_preprocessing.py`: Contains functions for loading and preprocessing the data.
- `Insurance_Model_Training.py`: Contains functions for training and evaluating multiple machine learning models while tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- `Insurance_unittest.py`: Contains unit tests for data preprocessing and model training functions.


Evaluation and explanation of the results from the machine learning models:

### Model Evaluation Results

#### 1. **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Best Parameters:**
  ```python
  {'model__max_depth': 10, 'model__min_samples_split': 5, 'model__n_estimators': 50}
  ```
- **R² Score:** 0.87
  - **Explanation:** An R² score of 0.87 means the Random Forest model explains 87% of the variance in the insurance charges. This indicates a strong fit and suggests that the model is capturing the relationship between features and the target variable quite well.
- **RMSE:** 4518.51
  - **Explanation:** The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) represents the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted and actual values. An RMSE of 4518.51 indicates that, on average, the model's predictions are off by approximately this amount. Lower RMSE values generally indicate better model performance.
- **MAE:** 2503.31
  - **Explanation:** The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average absolute error between predictions and actual values. An MAE of 2503.31 suggests that, on average, the model’s predictions deviate from the true values by this amount. Like RMSE, a lower MAE indicates better performance.

#### 2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Best Parameters:**
  ```python
  {'model__learning_rate': 0.1, 'model__max_depth': 3, 'model__n_estimators': 50}
  ```
- **R² Score:** 0.88
  - **Explanation:** The Gradient Boosting Regressor has an R² score of 0.88, meaning it explains 88% of the variance in the target variable. This is slightly better than the Random Forest Regressor, indicating a marginally better fit.
- **RMSE:** 4312.51
  - **Explanation:** With an RMSE of 4312.51, this model has a lower error magnitude compared to the Random Forest Regressor. This suggests that, on average, its predictions are closer to the actual values.
- **MAE:** 2455.81
  - **Explanation:** The MAE is lower than that of the Random Forest Regressor, indicating that the Gradient Boosting Regressor has a better average prediction accuracy.

#### 3. **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Best Parameters:**
  ```python
  {'model__max_depth': 10, 'model__min_samples_split': 5}
  ```
- **R² Score:** 0.77
  - **Explanation:** The Decision Tree Regressor has an R² score of 0.77, which is lower than the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models. This suggests that it explains 77% of the variance, indicating it may not capture the complexity of the data as well as the other models.
- **RMSE:** 5948.75
  - **Explanation:** The RMSE for the Decision Tree Regressor is the highest among the three models. This indicates that, on average, its predictions are further from the actual values compared to the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models.
- **MAE:** 2902.43
  - **Explanation:** The MAE is also the highest for the Decision Tree Regressor, showing it has the largest average prediction error.

### Summary and Recommendations

- **Gradient Boosting Regressor** has the best performance among the tested models, with the highest R² score and the lowest RMSE and MAE. It is a strong candidate for production due to its ability to explain the most variance and make the most accurate predictions.
  
- **Random Forest Regressor** is also a good performer but slightly lags behind the Gradient Boosting Regressor in terms of R² score and error metrics.

- **Decision Tree Regressor** has the lowest performance metrics, indicating that it may be too simple for this problem or may benefit from further tuning or more data.

### Next Steps

- **Deployment:** Consider deploying the Gradient Boosting Regressor model as it shows the best overall performance.
- **Further Tuning:** Exploring additional hyperparameter tuning for the Gradient Boosting model to potentially improve performance even further.
- **Feature Engineering:** Investigate if more features or different transformations of existing features could enhance model performance.
- **Model Interpretation:** Utilize model interpretation techniques like SHAP values to understand which features are influencing the predictions and how.
